        Solved using the Prefix & Suffix Product technique, the hint helped me.

        The core idea is that for any index 'i', the product of all elements except self 
        is equivalent to:
        (Product of all nums to the LEFT of i) * (Product of all nums to the RIGHT of i).

        Complexity:
        - Time: O(N) (We iterate through the list 3 times)
        - Space: O(N) (We use two extra arrays of size N)
